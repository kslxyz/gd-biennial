        <div class="cura-text">
          <p>The 2021 Graphic Design MFA Biennial is about everything and nothing. <i>Everything You Can Think Of; Nothing You Want</i> is a reflection of our varied experiences in this graduate program: what it is and what it is not.</p>

          <p><i>Everything You Can Think Of</i> and <i>Nothing You Want</i> correspond to two separate but related bodies of work—like two sides of a coin, informing one another—housed in one virtual biennial. Accordingly, the show may exhibit graphic design as would any traditional biennial, yet it may also make visible those things obscured by the polished pieces on display: the exertion, the exhaustion, the expense.</p>

          <p><i>Everything You Can Think Of</i> is abundance. Possibility and imagination. This exhibition represents a sliver of the output of the diverse, ambitious graduate student cohort at the Rhode Island School of Design. We are expanding our field through formal experimentation and critical writing. “Everything You Can Think Of” reflects the idealized MFA experience: The institution provides freedom, knowledge, and equipment for students to produce beautiful portfolios, pursue interesting research, and cultivate meaningful practices—but the experience often comes at great cost.</p>

          <p><i>Nothing You Want</i> is everything unseen. Artifacts of what students cannot reveal. Another sliver: financial precarity, sleepless nights, alienation, loneliness, frustration, depression, fatigue, burnout, anxiety, anger, shame, doubt, guilt, debt—things ugly and untidy, yet common in our graduate program and others, surely. The material on display reveals that students perform a calculus of neglect, where sleep, food and community are weighed against work, labor and production.</p>

          <p>A word of caution. Do not let one side of the show distract from the true message. We both admire the work on display and endorse the expressions of complaint. This show is a slim volume of the RISD GD MFA program in totality—beauty, ugliness, gaps, redactions, and erasures included. The message of the show exists in the tension between the two sides, including the complicity of graduate students.</p>

          <p>Exhibiting <i>Nothing You Want</i> is a precarious act. There is an imbalance of power between faculty, administration, and students. We are committed to challenging this imbalance but in so doing are left vulnerable and risk misinterpretation. We intend transformation, not malice, not insult. These grievances are revealed with care and consideration to induce positive change. The argument of <i>Everything You Can Think Of; Nothing You Want</i> is that the only way forward is transparency, testimony and open dialogue.</p>

          <p>2020 and its attendant crises have shown us that—while risk-taking and failure are encouraged—<i>failings</i> are unacceptable within the university. In the midst of burnout, physical and mental illness, and a global pandemic the institution has not sufficiently revised expectations regarding production and productivity. But as our shadow biennial, <i>Nothing You Want</i>, establishes: work is not just a product; it is also labor. 2020 has revealed that RISD students have inherited unsustainable systems which ignore or scorn student wellbeing. What we reluctantly accepted a year ago seems unendurable now. There must be a better way.</p>

          <p>Our programming attempts to reconcile what we endure and what we desire. Our speakers, all RISD alumni, will offer reimaginings of the MFA program. Many have become educators after graduating and they have seen both sides of MFA education; they offer perspectives on how institutions can care for students and faculty alike.</p>

          <p>Traditionally, a biennial is a moment to pause and reflect on the ideas and concerns of the RISD graphic design students during the past two years. Presenting the work of the MFA cohort in 2021 without reckoning with the material and emotional conditions of those same students would be a dereliction. We owe more to one another and to ourselves.</p>

          <p>We join with <a href="https://cueartfoundation.org/events/artcovidedu-studio-art-mfas-and-the-cost-of-remote-learning" target="_blank">students</a> <a href="https://www.fuc-series.org/" target="_blank">across</a> <a href="https://www.artforum.com/news/as-curricula-moves-online-yale-art-students-demand-tuition-refund-82531" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="http://www.gsamfa.net/" target="_blank">world</a> in saying: institutions must change if we are to reconcile everything and nothing. We want their full energy committed to our cause. Go girl, give us everything!</p>

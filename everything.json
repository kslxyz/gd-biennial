The book is non-linear and is structured based on a Matrix of relations that can be found on the cover (also the table of contents.) The relationship of elements that permeate my design processes behaves more like a gradient than a hierarchy and the book is structured to reflect this fluidity. From a distance, all the individual colors in a gradient are still apparent and visible but they still all relate to one another. They are part of a larger system living together in a state transition and response.",

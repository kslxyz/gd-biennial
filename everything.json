        "descrip": "U+16E99: Unsettling Grammars Or Artifactual Obfuscation is the fourth installment of my graphic design thesis on Black and Indigenous decolonial grammars. The project was submitted to the 2020 RISD Grad Show, an annual event and institutional milestone for graduating RISD MFA candidates. Postponed and restructured due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many students were unwilling or unable to submit work to the exhibition, drawing into question the relevance of a show so few could safely access as well as the institutional demands for labor and productivity even in times of great physical and financial peril. Accessibility, exploitation, and disregard for others’ well-being are long-standing issues in academia, archives, museums, and the art and design world. The deadly global pandemic, violent systemic racism, and the crisis of leadership within institutions only rendered these issues in sharper contrast.</p><p>The contextual frame of the 2020 RISD Grad Show seemed an appropriate backdrop for my thesis, which uses design to resist the extractive practices of neoliberal institutions. Art and academic institutions desire access to and ownership of the Black and Indigenous “other,” but have neither the will nor the ability to nurture Black and Indigenous people, knowledge, or socio-political movements. As a Black and Indigenous designer working to further decolonial movements, questions of how to navigate my relationship with colonial institutions like RISD shape my work.</p><p>U+16E99: Unsettling Grammars Or Artifactual Obfuscation presents the decolonial grammars of my research without definition or explication. The grammars are projected on two woven blankets—“artifacts”—which contain metadata concerning their use, but bear no memory of the Black and Indigenous knowledge it held. Illegibility and (un)memory are here articulated as poetic acts of refusal. Access, possession, and exploitation of Black and Indigenous knowledge desired by the institution are evaded without complete omission or disengagement. U+16E99: Unsettling Grammars Or Artifactual Obfuscation fulfills the requirements of the institution, allowing me to secure the benefits of my engagement while mitigating colonial relationships to the work.",
